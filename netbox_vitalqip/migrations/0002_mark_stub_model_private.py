"""Mark the unmanaged Vitalqip permission-anchor model as private.

The model exists only to attach the `configure_vitalqip` permission and has
no DB table. NetBox 4.5's /core/system/ view runs `Model.objects.count()` for
every public ObjectType, which crashes on the missing table. Flipping
`ObjectType.public = False` (matching the `_netbox_private = True` flag now
set on the model class) excludes it from that loop.
